Our labels are: 
		airplane -> 0
		automobile -> 1
		bird -> 2
		cat -> 3
		deer -> 4
		dog -> 5
		frog -> 6
		horse -> 7
		ship -> 8
		truck -> 9

We compute the prediction for the first 20 images and the result is: 
		Image: 0 had label 6 and now has 6
		Image: 1 had label 9 and now has 8
		Image: 2 had label 9 and now has 0
		Image: 3 had label 4 and now has 4
		Image: 4 had label 1 and now has 1
		Image: 5 had label 1 and now has 1
		Image: 6 had label 2 and now has 2
		Image: 7 had label 7 and now has 7
		Image: 8 had label 8 and now has 8
		Image: 9 had label 3 and now has 3

The created confusion matrix is: 

0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 
0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 0 0 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 1 
0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 

And this confusion matrix has the accuracy: 80
